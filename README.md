#### Quick Maths - where you are given an equation and you have to select whether the equation is right or wrong. You solve as many randomly generated problems as you wish within 30 seconds. You're given both physical (vibration) and visual feedback (text feedback and button wiggle-if wrong) based on your answer.

#### Background color changes based on the timer to further tense the situation and give user a sense of rush.

#### At the end of each game user is given a result sheet which gives feedback on how they performed based on an average metric. The metric is different for each game modes.

# 2. Time trials Shark
#### In this game mode, user is given 8 seconds to answer each question. There is no time limit, however questions only get harder. Timer resets after each correct answer. The same feedback mechanics for each question apply to this game mode as well. User is given both visual and physical feedback based on their answers.

# 3. Advanced Shark
#### Advanced shark is for those who really want a challenge. This game asks you the hard questions, however still maintaining a pattern so that you don't have to do as much math as just using common sense. Which is really the main point of this app. Advanced shark introduces square root, square and cube problems as well as upping the difficulty by making equations longer. No time limit in advanced shark. You go on for as long as you like, whenever you feel like you are done - just click on the timer and the session will end. A score card will be displayed letting you know how you did.

# Settings
#### This app includes a very powerful settings menu. You can customize the look of the app(dark mode), music, difficulty of questions and what kind of questions you get. 
#### Kids mode makes all the problems very easy - great to let kids learn and practice quick maths. 
#### You can enable dark mode if you're not feeling very bright and happy for some reason.
#### You can practice specific type of problems if you feel like you need more practice at it. The app will automatically start showing more problems that you're weak at. But if you feel like you only want that specific set of problems - you have the option.
